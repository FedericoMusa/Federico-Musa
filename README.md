# Hi, I'm Federico 👋

### Python Solutions | Oil & Gas Industry | Open Source Contributor

I bridge the gap between industrial field operations and professional software practices. I'm focused on making complex technical tools accessible through better documentation and onboarding experiences.

#### 🚀 Key Contribution: [PyModbus PR #2851](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/pull/2851)
Recently, I led an initiative to standardize the onboarding process for **PyModbus**, one of the most popular Python libraries for industrial protocols.

- **Outcome:** Successfully merged a comprehensive update to the README and troubleshooting guide.
- **Value Added:** Clarified the "editable" installation process, improved internal navigation, and standardized error messaging for new contributors.
- **Process:** Worked closely with maintainers through multiple review cycles to ensure professional standards and technical accuracy.

### 🚀 Key Contribution: PyModbus PR #2873 - Simulator Entry Point & DX Optimization
Standardized the official entry point documentation for the persistent simulator experience.
- Gap Detection: Identified and addressed a critical documentation void regarding persistent server instances for manual testing.
- Source Investigation: While updating docs, identified a "silent start" behavior where the simulator defaulted to internal configurations without user awareness, triggering a secondary architectural "armouring" initiative.
- Outcome: Merged a comprehensive update to the README.rst, including detailed parameter tables for CLI usage and standardized setup instructions.
- Strategic Alignment: Worked directly with core maintainers to transition the simulator from an ephemeral example to a robust, documented user tool.

#### 🚀 Key Contribution: [PyModbus PR #2849](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/pull/2873#event-22683831889)
🚀 Key Contribution: PyModbus PR #2877 - Simulator Armouring & Robustness
Successfully merged a critical architectural fix to the Modbus Simulator and restored 100% test coverage.
- Outcome: Implemented "Entry Point Armouring" by enforcing atomic configuration file validation at the simulator's start, preventing fatal server crashes and inconsistent states.
- Value Added: Eliminated "Double Logging" bugs and improved terminal DX by ensuring clean, professional error reporting for industrial users.
- Technical Rigor: Restored the project's 100% code coverage requirement by architecting asynchronous unit tests that correctly mock system-level exits ($sys.exit$).
- Standards Compliance: Aligned the codebase with strict PEP 8, POSIX (Ruff), and internationalization standards, ensuring a production-ready and localized developer experience.

#### 🛠️ Professional Profile
- **Industry Context:** Implementing Python-based solutions in the **Oil & Gas** sector.
- **Focus:** Troubleshooting, process automation, and developer experience (DX).
- **Philosophy:** Practical solutions over "fluff". If it's broken or confusing, I fix it.
