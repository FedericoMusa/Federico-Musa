### Python Solutions | Oil & Gas Industry | Open Source Contributor

I bridge the gap between industrial field operations and professional software practices. I'm focused on making complex technical tools accessible through better documentation and onboarding experiences.

#### 🚀 Key Contribution: [PyModbus PR #2851](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/pull/2851)
Recently, I led an initiative to standardize the onboarding process for **PyModbus**, one of the most popular Python libraries for industrial protocols.

- **Outcome:** Successfully merged a comprehensive update to the README and troubleshooting guide.
- **Value Added:** Clarified the "editable" installation process, improved internal navigation, and standardized error messaging for new contributors.
- **Process:** Worked closely with maintainers through multiple review cycles to ensure professional standards and technical accuracy.
